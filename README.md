# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project implements the A* search algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path in a simulated environment. The A* algorithm is renowned for its performance and accuracy in pathfinding and graph traversal.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the algorithm.
- **Pygame**: Utilized for creating the graphical interface to visualize the algorithm in action.

## Implementation Details
The project includes implementations of the A* algorithm alongside other common pathfinding techniques such as:
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
These algorithms are compared to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of A* in various scenarios.
